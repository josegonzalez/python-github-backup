# Important notice regarding filed issues

This project already fills my needs, and as such I have no real reason to continue it's development. This project is otherwise provided as is, and no support is given.

If pull requests implementing bug fixes or enhancements are pushed, I am happy to review and merge them (time permitting).

If you wish to have a bug fixed, you have a few options:

- Fix it yourself and file a pull request.
- File a bug and hope someone else fixes it for you.
- Pay me to fix it (my rate is $200 an hour, minimum 1 hour, contact me via my [github email address](https://github.com/josegonzalez) if you want to go this route).

In all cases, feel free to file an issue, they may be of help to others in the future.
